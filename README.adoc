= Java Code Styles

IntelliJ IDEA code style settings for Rogue's Dev Java and Android projects.
These are based off of Square's code styles. Why re-invent the wheel when
the best minds out there have already done the work for us.


== Installation

 * On Unix, run the `install.sh` script. Windows users should use `install.bat` instead.
 * Restart IntelliJ if it's running.
 * Open IntelliJ Project Settings -> Code Styles, change the code style for the
   project to the one you want.
